# Accidentally Vegan

When doing online shopping or looking at products on tesco.ie, it is really tedious checking each item to see if it is vegan. This Python web scraper extracts data on each item in the Fresh Food, Food Cupboard, Frozen Food and Drinks sections and checks if it contains the string 'Suitable for Vegans'. It writes the product details to a text file.

# Installation 

```
git clone https://github.com/emilymcgivern/accidentally-vegan.git
cd accidentally-vegan
scrapy crawl tesco  
```
